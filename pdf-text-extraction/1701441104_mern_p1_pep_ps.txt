Problem Statement and Motivation
Real-time scenario:
The online food ordering application is a website tailored for the food delivery 
industry. It enables hotels and restaurants to expand their business reach 
while minimizing labor costs. This system simplifies the management of an 
online menu, allowing customers to effortlessly browse and add items to 
their wish list.
As a front-end developer for an online food ordering application, your 
primary role involves designing a user-friendly and responsive interface, 
ensuring compatibility across various devices. Key tasks include coding the 
frontend functionality using web technologies, integrating with backend 
services for features like user authentication and order processing, and 
implementing a secure login for administrators.

Industry Relevance
The following tools are widely being used in the industry to design the 
frontend of a web application:
1.Git: It serves as a version control system, allowing developers to track 
changes, collaborate on different versions of the codebase, and manage 
updates without overwriting any part of the project.
2.HTML: It is used to structure the content on the web pages, laying out the 
foundation for text, images, and other multimedia elements in the project.
3.CSS: It is employed to style and layout the web pages designed with 
HTML. It controls the visual appearance, from fonts and colors to spacing 
and responsiveness.

Industry Relevance
4.JavaScript: It adds interactivity and dynamic elements to the web pages. It 
is used for client-side scripting to create responsive, interactive elements 
for the user interface.
5.Bootstrap: It is a front-end framework used for designing responsive and 
mobile-first web pages. It provides pre-written CSS and JavaScript 
templates for various interface components, significantly speeding up the 
development process.

Tasks
The following tasks outline the frontend development process of an online 
food ordering app:
1.Set up a remote Git repository on GitHub to manage and track the 
development of the frontend
2.Use HTML to lay out the structural foundation of the application
3.Apply CSS to style the HTML elements, focusing on visual appeal, layout, 
and responsiveness
4.Integrate Bootstrap for its responsive design components
5.Use JavaScript to add dynamic features, such as interactive menus, form 
validations, real-time updating of cart items, and handling user events
6.Implement A JAX calls for loading menu items or sending data to the 
server without refreshing the page
